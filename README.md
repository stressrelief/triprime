# Excursions in cryptography for the sake of secrecy, and deniability.
...that's what we tell ourselves.

# Basics
Consider an object, D, of a fixed bit size.

Now, fathom a prime, P0, large enough (larger than) to encapsulate that object.
Let us assume we have divined the modular multiplicative inverses of P0, P0(i,\`i), and can conjure them at will.

We have all the reagents for a disastrous ritual to summon forth Assymetricyptogorgonomicron.

`Assymetricyptogorgonomicron`

Using the darkest of arts, we will evoke two more primes, the first, P1, large enough to encapsulate D and the size of P0. The second prime, P2, at least twice the size of P1. Mysteriously, we have P1(i,\`i), and P2(i,\`i) modular multiplicative inverses.
