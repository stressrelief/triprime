# Excursions in cryptography for the sake of secrecy, and deniability.
...that's what we tell ourselves.

# Basics
Consider an object, D, of a fixed bit size.
Now, fathom a prime, P, large enough (larger than) to encapsulate that object.
Let us assume we have divined the modular multiplicative inverses of P, P(i,\`i), and can conjure them at will.

We have all the reagents for a disastrous ritual to summon forth Assymetricyptogorgonomicron.
