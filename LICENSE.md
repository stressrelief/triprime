# The Beheading of the Twice Bourne
So shall it be written. So shall it be done.

`Once, fell I, the tree of soaring songs and serenity.`

`Upon it, fruit, to delight the taste and temper.`

`Bore it upon my back, to carry, climb, and clamber.`

`Arose from it, a tiny sprig, sparse, and stringy.`

`From there, another canopy to cradle and care.`

`Tore from it, the root of life long lasting.`
